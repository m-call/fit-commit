Welcome to FitCommit!

Fit commit is a handy online fitness application that allows a user to track their fitness.
Once a user signs up and creates an account they can add workouts and track their fitness via a custom fitness score.

Fit commit uses javascript for the frontend, handlebars for the html, node.js for the backend, express to run the server, materialize for the css styling, and sequilize for the database management.
